## Mobile Application QA Project (Manual + API Testing)

# Overview
This repository showcases a complete Quality Assurance (QA) workflow for a mobile application, including:
- Manual functional testing
- Non-functional testing
- API verification (manual & automated using Postman scripts)
  
It demonstrates the ability to design, execute, and document tests, verify backend data, and provide traceable evidence of testing activities.

# QA Work
- Manual Testing: Verified functionality, usability, compatibility, performance, and security
- API Testing: Executed manual and automated GET tests in Postman to ensure backend data accuracy and consistency with the app
- Documentation: Maintained test cases, bug reports, screenshots, and videos for traceability
  
# Test Documentation
- Excel Workbook: TESTDATA_BUGS_TESTCASES.xlsx
      * Test Cases: Steps, expected vs actual results, pass/fail, comments
      * Bug Report: Bug ID, severity, priority, linked test cases, steps, evidence
- Execution Summary: All critical functional and non-functional tests executed with documented results

# Repository Structure

- Postman_API_Collection.json : Postman collection for API tests
- TESTDATA_BUGS_TESTCASES.xlsx : Test cases & bug reports
- README.md : Project overview and instructions

# Tools & Technologies
- Testing Tools: Postman (manual + automated API testing), Excel (test cases & bug reports)
- Environment: Java 17, Node.js 18 + npm, Android Studio with Android 15 SDK
- Device / Platform: Android 15 (Realme 11)
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

# Key Outcomes
- Verified all functional and non-functional requirements
